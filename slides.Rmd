### Data Science Manager

---

# What I do

- Manage an data science team
--

  - Mentor and develop new data scientists
  - Lots and lots of writing / communication
--

  - Constant context switching and meetings

---

# What my team does

- We investigate and forecast internal and external infrastructure demand
--

- Build transparent, accessible, performant data products
  - Simple, explainable linear models 
  - Automated and customized report
  - Shiny dashboards #dataviz
  - APIs
- Plan and deploy data pipelines
--

- Google stuff I don't know, constantly

# Fun stats

- Hired 9 data scientists
  - 5 PhDs, 4 MAs
  - Enough to now have 2 teams
- Learned loads from smart colleagues

---

# How I Got Here

- Luck, mostly (twitter `#rstats`)
--

- Being an amazing research assistant
- But also a terrible academic
--

- Enormous interest in programming (`R`, `bash`)

# Expert

- Statistics
- Causal Inference
- Communication & Documentation

--

# "Good Enough"

- Software Engineering
- Data Engineering
- Reproducibility
- Program Management

---

# Statistics

- Theory matters
  - Start simple
  - Be deliberate
--

- Simple linear models are
  - Powerful
  - Interpretable
  - Flexible
  - Reliable

---

# Causal Inference

- Causality from different perspectives
  - doCalculus, DAGs (stats-y)
  - Diff-in-diff, quasi-experiments (econ-y)

--

# What about Machine Learning?
 
- Out-of-the-box Black-boxes
- Difficult to interpret
- Often overkill

---

# Software Engineering

- Shell (`bash`) programming
  - fast, universal, and timeless
  - `awk`, `sed`, `less`, `tr`, `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `cat`
- Open Source scripting languages
  - `python`, `R`, `julia`
- Version Control
  - `git`, Github or gitlab
- Regular Expressions
- Unit Testing
  
---

# Data Engineering

- Simple Data Structures and formats
  - JSON, XML, plain text (csv)
- Databases
  - Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, Apache Drill
  - **Never Excel**
- Languages
  - `SQL`, `R` packages like [`dbplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr)
  - `bash`
  - `scala`, `python`, `java` (if you're brave)

---

# Reproducibility

- GNU Make
- `drake` / `targets`
- RMarkdown & Jupyter Notebooks
- **Docker**

# Program Management 

- Statements of Work, Project proposals
- Github repos, issues, projects & milestones
- Anything that helps you get organized

---

# Other Advice

- Work as an Research Assistant
  - Real data and project challenges 
- Try to get an internship
  - Don't just aim for a top tech firm
  - Mid-level firms and start-ups also valuable
