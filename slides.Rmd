# What I do

- Co-manage a data science team
- Investigate and forecast global infrastructure demand
--

- Build tools and packages
- Plan and deploy data pipelines
--

- Google stuff I don't know, constantly

---

# How I Got Here

- Luck, mostly (twitter `#rstats`)
--

- Being an amazing research assistant
- But also a terrible academic
--

- Enormous interest in programming (`R`, `bash`)

# Some Valuable Advice

(For getting a job but also for becoming a capable and productive researcher)

---

# Expert

- Statistics
- Causal Inference

--

# "Good Enough"

- Software Engineering
- Data Engineering
- Reproducibility
- Program Management

---

# Statistics

- Theory matters
  - Start simple
  - Be deliberate
--

- Simple linear models are
  - Powerful
  - Interpretable
  - Flexible
  - Reliable

---

# Causal Inference

- Causality
  - Directed Acyclic Graph (DAGs)
  - Diff-in-Diff
  - Better predictions
--

- What about Machine Learning?
  - Out-of-the-box Black-boxes
  - Difficult to interpret
  - Often overkill

---

# Software Engineering

- Shell (`bash`) programming
  - fast, universal, and timeless
  - `awk`, `sed`, `less`, `tr`, `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `cat`
- Open Source scripting languages
  - `python`, `R`, `julia`
- Version Control
  - `git`, Github or gitlab
- Regular Expressions
- Unit Testing
  
---

# Data Engineering

- Simple Data Structures and formats
  - JSON, XML, plain text (csv)
- Curated Databases
  - SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, Apache Drill
  - **Never Excel**
- Languages
  - `SQL`, `R` packages like [`dbplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr)
  - `bash`, again (cleaning data, building pipelines)

---

# Reproducibility

- GNU Make
- `drake` / `targets`
- RMarkdown & Jupyter Notebooks
- **Docker**

# Program Management 

- Github repos, issues, & projects
- Planning, scoping, milestoning

---

# Other Advice

- Work as an Research Assistant
  - Real data and project challenges 
- Try to get an internship
  - Don't just aim for a top tech firm
  - Mid-level firms and start-ups also valuable
